# Web Programming Example Project - Toronto Traffic Cameras

This project is meant to expose WEB222 students to a number of common web
programming tasks and techniques, from HTML to CSS to JavaScript.  It uses
live data to create a usable web app.

The goal of the project is to create a web based viewer of all Toronto
traffic cameras.  The city of Toronto provides a free dataset of this
information, as well as live camera feeds, see:

[https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-cameras/](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-cameras/)

> The Traffic Camera dataset contains the location and number for every Traffic camera in the City of Toronto. These datasets will be updated within 2 minutes when cameras are added, changed, or removed.

NOTE: a possible solution is available on the [possible-solution branch](https://github.com/sictweb/toronto-traffic-example/tree/possible-solution).

## Step 1: Setup

Start by [downloading the code for this project as a `.zip` file](https://github.com/sictweb/toronto-traffic-example/archive/master.zip).

Unzip the file and `cd` into the directory, then install all dependencies:

```
cd toronto-traffic-example
npm install
```

## Step 2: Modelling Intersection data in JavaScript

Our first task is to turn the text data in the [toronto-intersection-cameras.csv](toronto-intersection-cameras.csv)
into a set of JavaScript objects we can use.  The dataset is available in a number
of formats, and we'll begin by using the [CSV (comma separated values) version](http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/Data/tmcearthcameras.csv). 

### CSV Data Format

The format of the data is Comma Separated Values (CSV), with each line containing
the following data (and data format):

1. Camera Number <String>: the camera number (e.g., `Camera8001`)
1. Latitude <Number>: the camera's location latitude (e.g., `43.643079`)
1. Longitude <Number>: the camera's location longitude (e.g., `-79.381407`)
1. Main Road <String>: name of the intersection's main road (e.g., `Richmond St E`) 
1. Cross Road <String>: name of the intersection's cross road (e.g., `Parliament St`)
1. Traffic Image <String URL>: image URL of the intersection's traffic (e.g., `http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/CameraImages/loc8001.jpg`)
1. North View Image <String URL>: optional image URL for the intersection's north view (e.g., `http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8001n.jpg`)
1. East View Image <String URL>: optional image URL for the intersection's east view (e.g., `http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8001e.jpg`)
1. South View Image <String URL>: optional image URL for the intersection's south view (e.g., `http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8001s.jpg`)
1. West View Image <String URL>: optional image URL for the intersection's west view (e.g., `http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8001w.jpg`)

### Camera URLs

The Traffic Image camera URLs are based on the intersection's Camera Number, and
take the following format:

http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/CameraImages/loc{cameraNumber}>.jpg

For example, the camera at Finch and Don Mills is:

[http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/CameraImages/loc8093.jpg](http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/CameraImages/loc8093.jpg)

The live image looks like this:

![Example camera image](http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/CameraImages/loc8093.jpg)

The various North, East, South, and West views also use the Camera Number, and
take the following format:

http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc{cameraNumber}{direction}.jpg

Where <direction> is one of 'n', 'e', 's', or 'w'.

For example, the view North at Finch and Don Mills is:

[http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8093n.jpg](http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8093n.jpg)

![Example of North view](http://opendata.toronto.ca/transportation/tmc/rescucameraimages/ComparisonImages/loc8093n.jpg)

### JavaScript Objects

1. `Location` represents a geographic location by latitude and longitude
1. `CameraViews` represents a set of `north`, `east`, `south`, and `west` image URLs for different camera views
1. `Intersection` represents an intersection, with the intersection's `id`, `location`, `mainRoad`, `crossRoad`, `trafficUrl`, and `cameraViews`.
1. `Intersections` represents a parsed set of `Intersection` objects

### Implementation and Tests

Each of the Objects above needs to get implemented.  There are files in the `src/`
directory for each of the Objects, as well as some other files that have already been written.

Similarly, there are tests written in `test/` for each of the objects, and all their
methods.

We need to implement all the code in `src/` so that it passes the tests in `test/`.

You can run the tests using:

```
npm test
```

### Important JavaScript Concepts To Research/Use

In order to complete this assignment, you'll need to use a number of techniques
and language features.  Some of these we have covered in class already, others
you will need to research.

Below is a list of things I assume you'll need, and which you should be aware of
as you work on this code:

- Declaring Constructor Functions
- Using `this` in an Object to access its properties
- Defining methods on a Constructor's `prototype` vs. the instance
- Using Constructor functions to create `new` instances
- Using Strings, specifically: `split()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`,
  `replace()`, string concatenation and/or Template Literals
- Using Arrays, specifically: `length`, `push()`, `splice()`, `forEach()`,
  `filter()`, `find()`, `sort()`, `slice()`
- Working with a `Set`, and converting a `Set` to an `Array` using `Array.from()`

### Debugging in the Browser

To make things easier to work with, all of the JavaScript has
been separated out into separate files.  Before we can use them
all together, we need to bundle (i.e., combine) all our JavaScript into a single file.

To do this, we're going to use the [Parcel Bundler](https://en.parceljs.org/).  To use it, run the following command:

```
npm start

> toronto-traffic-example@1.0.0 start toronto-traffic-example
> parcel index.html

Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨  Built in 1.12s.
```

This will "build" your code, bundling all the scripts together,
and put everything in the `dist/` folder.  It will also start
a development web server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).  Open it in your browser.

Whatever code you put in the [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) file
will get run when the page loads.  Open your `console` and you'll see various things printed there already.

As you implement your functions and objects, you can try writing
small test programs in [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) and then
`console.log()` the results and/or use the browsers Debugger to
see what's happening.  Doing so will help you understand how everything is working.

NOTE: use `CTRL+c` to stop the development web server.

## Step 3: Create a Web UI to Display the Data

After we get the data loaded and modelled in JavaScript,
we'll need to create a web UI to allow the user to interact
with the data.

In the coming weeks we'll add more details about how to approach this.
